    In the line of code below, the format() string method puts whatever is in between
    the parens into the curly brace placeholders of the print statement.  The '0' inside
    each curly brace is a positional number placeholder.  So if format() had more than
    one value inside its parens, that number wuld tell you which value to drop in.

    example:
    print('{1} and {0}'.format('spam', 'eggs'))
    eggs and spam

    '''
    print("{0} A{0}{0} B{0}{0} C\n".format(emptySpace))
    '''
    This is what prints when you run the game:

     ||          ||          ||
    @_1@         ||          ||
   @@_2@@        ||          ||
  @@@_3@@@       ||          ||
 @@@@_4@@@@      ||          ||
@@@@@_5@@@@@     ||          ||
      A           B           C

    The emptySpace variable is set to the number of spaces to place in between
    each label, which is based on TOTAL_DISKS Rather than use an f-string, as in
    print(f'{emptySpace} A{emptySpace}{emptySpace} B{emptySpace}{emptySpace} C\n').
    We use the format() string method instead. This allows us to use the same emptySpace
    argument wherever {0} appears in the associated string, producing shorter
    and more readable code than the f-string version.
